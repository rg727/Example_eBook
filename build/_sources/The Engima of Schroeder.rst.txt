The Enigma of Schroeder
************

Schroeder is a fictional character in the comic strip Peanuts, created by Charles M. Schulz. He is a
musical prodigy, often portrayed playing a toy piano, particularly compositions by Ludwig van
Beethoven who Schroeder seeks to emulate in various aspects of his life. Throughout the comics,
Schroeder demonstrates the ability to play multi-octave pieces such as :bolditalic: `Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G
Minor` while restricted to a toy piano which theoretically would only contain one octave. Even more
confounding is his ability to play long classical pieces without a proper piano stool or correct posture.

Various characters are shown to lean on Schroeder’s piano to listen and sometimes offer unsolicited
opinions, much to the annoyance of Schroeder. In particular Lucy van Pelt, who often seeks attention
from Schroeder, merely upsets him by suggesting that Beethoven isn’t a great composer. Schroeder will
either walk away or swipe his piano causing Lucy to tumble away out of view. What isn’t made clear by
Schulz is how Lucy can continually enter into Schroeder’s house. At the end of the series, when Lucy
moves away, Schroeder is unsuccessful in attempts to play music and realizes that Lucy in fact has
become his muse (.
