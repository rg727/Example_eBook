The Enigma of Schroeder
************

Schroeder is a fictional character in the comic strip Peanuts, created by Charles M. Schulz. He is a
musical prodigy who is often portrayed playing particularly complex compositions by Ludwig van
Beethoven who Schroeder seeks to emulate in various aspects of his life. Throughout the comics,
Schroeder demonstrates the ability to play multi-octave pieces such as *Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G
Minor* on a toy grand piano which, in theory, would only contain one octave. Even more
confounding is his ability to play long classical pieces without a proper piano stool or correct posture.

    Various strips portray Snoopy enjoying and reacting emotionally to Schroeder's musical performances :cite:`schulz2009celebrating` 


Various characters are shown to lean on Schroeder’s piano to listen and sometimes offer unsolicited
opinions, much to the annoyance of Schroeder. Lucy van Pelt, who often seeks attention
from Schroeder, upsets him by suggesting that Beethoven isn’t a great composer. Schroeder will
either walk away in bewilderment or swipe his piano causing Lucy to tumble away. What isn’t made clear by
Schulz is how Lucy can continually enter into Schroeder’s house. At the end of the series, when Lucy
moves away, Schroeder is unsuccessful in attempts to play music and realizes that Lucy in fact has
become his muse. This realization further complicates the reader's understanding of the complex relationship
between the two characters.

A logical question that the reader might ask is: 


.. epigraph::

	"What is the coefficient of friction of the floor in Schroeder’s house in order for a member of the Peanuts gang to be able to lean on Schroeder’s piano without him having to apply a balancing force while playing?”

.. note::
	The coefficient of friction ratio of the frictional force resisting the motion of two surfaces in contact to the normal force pressing the two surfaces together.


Mathematically, the coefficient of friction :math:`{\mu}` is defined in the following equation: 

.. math::

    \mu=F/N


where :math:`F` is the frictional force and :math:`N` is the normal force.
